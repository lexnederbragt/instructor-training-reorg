We'll now get started with our first round of learning some theory, how it
relates to Software and Data Carpentry, and putting that theory into practice.

## Carpentries Pedagogical Model

The Carpentries aim to teach computational competence to learners. This can not be achieved solely by describing how 
these tasks should be completed; it requires showing them how to solve specific problems with specific tools. We can 
then proceed from that point of understanding into a larger conversation about how researchers should develop, 
use, and curate software.

A critical component of this process is that learners are able to practice what they are learning in real time, get 
feedback on what they are doing, and then apply those lessons learned to the next step in the learning process. Having 
learners help each other during the workshops also helps to reinforce concepts taught during the workshops.

A Carpentries workshop is an interactive event -- for learners and instructors. As much as possible, we aim to be giving 
and receiving feedback throughout the course of a workshop. We incorporate assessments within the lesson materials and 
ask for feedback on sticky notes during lunch breaks and at the end of each day. In this way, instructors can adjust the 
pace and content of a workshop on the fly to meet the needs of the learners in that group, as well as collect feedback 
that will help us improve lesson materials or methodology for workshops yet to come. Instructors and helpers also provide
feedback to learners throughout workshops in order to get them unstuck or provide a greater depth of understanding about 
the materials. Interacting in this way with the learners helps us determine how they are doing and figure out what concepts
people are having trouble with or where we might be able to move along more quickly. 

## The Acquisition of Skill

Our approach is based on the work of researchers like Benner,
who applied the [Dreyfus model of skill acquisition][wikipedia-dreyfus-skill]
in her studies of
[how nurses progress from novice to expert](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0270467604265061) 
([see also books by Patricia Benner](https://www.amazon.com/Patricia-E.-Benner/e/B001IGLSW4)). This work indicates that 
through practice and formal instruction, learners acquire skills and advance through distinct stages. In simplified form,
the three stages of this model are:

*   *Novice*: someone who doesn't know what they don't know, i.e.,
    they don't yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how they relate.
    One sign that someone is a novice is that their questions "aren't even wrong".

    > Example: A *novice* learner in a Carpentries workshop might never have heard of the bash shell, and therefore 
    may have no understanding of how it relates to their file system or other programs on their computer.

*   *Competent practitioner*: someone who has enough understanding for everyday purposes. They won't know all the details 
of how something works and their understanding may not be entirely accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal 
tasks with normal effort under normal circumstances.

    > Example: A *competent practitioner* in a Carpentries workshop might have used the shell before and understand how to
    move around directories and use individual programs, but they might not understand how they can fit these programs 
    together to build scripts and automate large tasks.

*   *Expert*: someone who can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary,
    diagnose the causes of problems, and so on.

    > Example: An *expert* in a Carpentries workshop may have experience writing and running shell scripts and, when 
    presented with a problem, immediately sees how these skills can be used to solve the problem.

We will discuss expertise in more detail in [a later lesson]({{ page.root }}/04-expertise/).

## Cognitive Development and Mental Models

Effective learning is facilitated by the creation of a mental model of the domain,
but what exactly do we mean by a mental model?
One example is the ball-and-spring model of molecules that most of us encountered in high school chemistry.
Atoms aren't actually balls,
and their bonds aren't actually springs,
but the model does a good job of helping people reason about chemical compounds and their reactions.

We can also distinguish between a *novice* and a *competent
practitioner* based on the existence of this big picture mental model.

*     A *novice* is someone who has not yet built a mental model of the domain.
They therefore reason by analogy and guesswork,
borrowing bits and pieces of their mental models of other domains
which seem superficially similar.
*     A *competent practitioner* is someone who has a mental model that's good enough for everyday purposes. This model 
does not have to be completely accurate in order to be useful:
for example,
the average driver's mental model of how a car works probably doesn't include
most of the complexities that a mechanical engineer would be concerned with.

{: .challenge}

One key insight from research on cognitive development is that
novices, competent practitioners, and experts each need to be taught differently.
In particular,
presenting novices with a pile of facts early on is counter-productive,
because they don't yet have a model or framework to fit those facts into.
In fact,
presenting too many facts too soon can actually reinforce
the incorrect mental model they've cobbled together.

Most learners coming to Software/Data Carpentry lessons are novices,
and do not have a strong mental model of the concepts we are teaching.
Thus, our
primary goal is *not*
to teach the syntax of a particular programming language, or the detailed methods involved in doing research in a
particular domain, but *to help them construct a working mental model*
so that they have something to attach facts to. In other words, to teach people how to think about programming and data 
management
(and about using computers in research more generally).

### Why We Go Slowly

The transition from novice to competent practitioner is no more
and no less than
the construction of correct (enough) categories,
i.e.,
the construction of a new mental model of this new intellectual domain.
The goal of education for novices is, therefore,
to help them form the right categories.
Until they've done that,
trying to impart "mere information" just confuses them (and is therefore a waste of time).

This is one of the reasons software documentation is so often frustrating.
Reference material is opaque to someone who doesn't know what they're looking for,
such as a novice who doesn't yet have a mental map of the domain.
On the other hand,
tutorials meant to help people build such a map
are too slow and too diffuse for people who already have one.
It is possible to craft something that serves both communities,
but it's often simpler to address their needs separately.

As an example of this idea's practical implications,
our [lesson on the Unix shell][swc-shell-novice] only introduces 12 commands,
and we usually spend two and a half hours working through it.
Twelve and a half minutes per command may seem glacially slow,
but the lesson's real purpose is to teach learners about paths,
history, wildcards, pipes and filters,
command-line arguments, redirection,
and all the other big ideas on which the shell depends,
and without which people cannot understand how to use commands
(or how to read their manual pages).

That model also includes things like:

*   Anything you repeat manually, you'll eventually get wrong
    (so let the computer repeat things for you by using tab completion
    and the `history` command).
*   Lots of little tools, combined as needed, are more productive than
    a handful of "kitchen sink" programs.
    (This motivates the pipe-and-filter model.)

These two examples illustrate something else as well.
Learning consists of more than "just" building mental models
and pouring information into them;
creating linkages between concepts and facts is as least as important.
Telling people that they shouldn't repeat things,
and that they should try to think in terms of little pieces loosely joined,
both set the stage for discussing functions.
Explicitly referring back to pipes and filters in the shell when introducing functions
helps solidify both ideas.

## Building Useful Mental Models

> It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble.
> It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.  
> — Mark Twain
{: .quotation}

Mental models are hardly ever built from scratch. Every learner comes to a topic
with some amount of information, ideas and opinions about the topic. This is true even
in the case where a learner can't articulate their prior knowledge and beliefs.  

In many cases, this prior knowledge is incomplete or inaccurate. Inaccurate beliefs can be termed "misconceptions" and
can impeded learning by making it more difficult for learners to incorporate new, correct information into their mental
models.
Correcting learners' misconceptions is at least as important as presenting them with correct information.
Broadly speaking, misconceptions fall into three categories:

*   Simple *factual errors*, such as believing that Vancouver is the capital of British Columbia.
    These are the easiest to correct.
*   *Broken models*, such as believing that motion and acceleration must be in the same direction.
    We can address these by having them reason through examples to see contradictions.
*   *Fundamental beliefs*,
    such as "the world is only a few thousand years old"
    or "human beings cannot be affecting the planet's climate".
    These beliefs are deeply connected to the learner's social identity
    and are the hardest to change. 

Since Software and Data Carpentry are focused on novices, and the building of
strong mental models, we're most interested in the middle category of misconceptions.
While teaching, we want to expose learners' broken models so that we can help them build better ones.

## Assessing Mental Models

How do we expose misconceptions, especially as they pertain to broken models? How
can we, in-class, know whether the learners already understand this topic
(so that the class can move on),
and if not,
what misconceptions and gaps in their knowledge we should address.

To be effective, instructors need feedback on their learners' progress,
and insight into their learners' mental models.
This is usually done through two kinds of assessment:

*   *Summative assessment* is used
    to tell whether the desired learning took place
    and whether the learner is ready to move on.
    Learners either "pass" or "fail" a summative assessment.
    One example is a driving exam,
    which tells the rest of society whether someone can safely be allowed on the road.
*   *Formative assessment* takes place during teaching and learning.
    Its main purpose is to guide by telling both the instructor and the learner what to focus on.
    Learners don't "pass" or "fail" formative assessments.
    For example,
    a music teacher might ask a student to play a scale very slowly
    in order to see whether she is breathing correctly,
    and if she is not,
    what she should change.
    Its second purpose is to prepare learners for summative assessments:
    no one should ever encounter a question on an exam
    for which the teaching did not prepare them.

Formative assessments provide feedback to both instructors and learners about learners' level of understanding of the
material. For learners, this feedback can help focus their study efforts. For instructors, it allows them to refocus
their instruction to respond to challenges that learners are facing.  

Formative assessment is most useful when it happens frequently (we'll talk about how frequently later) and when the
results are easily interpretable by the learner and instructor.

The most widely used is probably multiple choice questions (MCQs).
When designed well,
these can do much more than just measure how much someone knows.
For example,
suppose we are teaching children multi-digit addition.
A well-designed MCQ would be:

~~~
Q: what is 27 + 15 ?
a) 42
b) 32
c) 312
d) 33
~~~
{: .source}

The correct answer is 42,
but each of the other answers provides valuable insight.

>> ## Solution
>>
>> *   If the child answers 32, she is throwing away the carry completely.
>> *   If she answers 312, she knows that she can't just discard the carried '1',
>>     but doesn't understand that it's actually a ten
>>     and needs to be added into the next column.
>>     In other words,

>> *   If she answers 33 then she knows she has to carry the 1,
>>     but is carrying it back into the same column it came from.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Each of these incorrect answers is a *plausible distractor* with *diagnostic power*.
"Plausible" means that it looks like it could be right:
instructors will often put supposedly-silly answers like "a fish!" on MCQs,
but (a) they don't provide any insight
and (b) learners actually don't find them funny.
"Diagnostic power" means that each of the distractors helps the instructor figure out
what concepts learners are having difficulty with.

Instructors should use MCQs
or some other kind of formative assessment
at least every 10-15 minutes
in order to make sure that the class is actually learning.
Since the average attention span is usually only this long,
formative assessments also help break up instructional time
and re-focus attention.
Formative assessments can also be used preemptively:
if you start a class with an MCQ and everyone can answer it correctly,
then you can safely skip the part of the lecture
in which you were going to explain something that your learners already know.
(Doing this also helps show learners that the instructor cares about how much they are learning.)

Designing an MCQ with plausible distractors is useful
even if it is never used in class
because it forces the instructor to think about the learners' mental models
and how they might be broken---in short,
to put themselves into the learners' heads
and see the topic from their point of view.
