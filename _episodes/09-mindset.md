### Mindset

Do you believe that you're just not good at math? Or maybe you're not artistic? Not good at sports? If any of these
sound like you, you probably have a fixed mindset when it comes to mathematical, artistic and/or athletic ability.

Carol Dweck, now a professor of Psychology at Stanford University, has conducted decades of research focused on understanding
people's attitudes towards ability, our beliefs about whether ability is ingrained or developed, and how those beliefs
affect our perseverence in learning. She's discovered that, in any given area, people tend to have either a fixed mindset - believing that
someone's ability in that area is intrinsic, you're either born with it or you're not - or a growth mindset - believing that, with enough effort,
almost anyone can learn almost anything.

People with a fixed mindset tend to avoid effort and to give up when faced with failure or challenge. They also
tend to take fewer risks, be less likely to take an opportunity to learn something new and to feel best about themselves when they perform flawlessly.
In contrast, people with a growth mindset tend to actively seek challenges and to work harder when faced with failure. They regularly take risks and
take advantage of opportunities for learning new skills. In fact, initial difficulties in a topic make them more interested and motivated to learn!

People who believe that ability is intrinsic view every situation as a test. A failure indicates that they don't have the natural ability they need
to succeed. Thus, students with a fixed-mindset will *decrease* their study time after receiving a poor exam score, because they see this score as a
judgement that they aren't good at that subject and shouldn't waste their time trying. A growth-mindset student will increase the amount of time that
they study after the same score, seeing it as an indication that they need to try harder to improve in that area.  

This attitude towards failure leads fixed-mindset people to avoid situations where they will be required to perform. They will not volunteer to answer
questions in class or to demonstrate a sports technique to their team. This tendency prevents fixed-mindset people from getting opportunities to practice
and receive feedback, which as we've discussed (FIXME add link to practice module) is essential to learning.

> ## Test your Mindset
> You can learn about your own mindset by taking the official [mindset self-assessment](https://mindsetonline.com/testyourmindset/step1.php).
> Keep in mind that your mindset may differ in different areas. For example, you might have a fixed mindset with respect to artistic ability,
> but a growth mindset with respect to computing skill.

If you recognize aspects of the fixed mindset in yourself, don't panic! Like everything else, a growth mindset can be learned. We're going to talk about some
strategies that will help you promoting a growth mindset in your learners and yourself.

### Praise talk  

The way in which we praise learners has an important impact on their mindset development. [Carol Dweck's research](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/oct07/vol65/num02/The-Perils-and-Promises-of-Praise.aspx)
investigated three types of praise: performance-based, effort-based and improvement-based, and looked at how these
types of praise influence learner's mindsets.

We're most used to hearing performance-based praise. This sort of praise focuses on outcomes and implies that the
outcome (for example, getting a correct answer) is the most important part of the task. It is often (but not always)
combined with language that explicitly or implicitly supports the "intrinsic" model of competence. For example, "You
did a great job! You must be very smart."

Effort-based praise focuses on the learner's hard work. For example, "You did a good job, you must have worked very hard."
Exposing learners frequently to this type of praise helps them to transition from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset by
changing their perception of effort. For fixed-mindset people, if something doesn't come easy to you, it means that you
don't have natural ability and shouldn't bother. People with a growth mindset are much more likely to persevere in the face of challenge
and accomplish their goals.

Improvement-based praise is related to praise based on effort, but explicitly draws a learner's attention to the progress they've made.
For example, "You're doing so much better at this than last time, you must have worked very hard." This helps reinforce a growth-mindset by
highlighting our ability to improve with effort.

### Error framing  

One of the barriers to learning is avoidance of making errors. Errors are associated with negative emotions, which leads to students being fearful of making them. *Error framing* encourages students to understand that making errors are valuable learning opportunities instead of having negative consequences. For example, the [Language Acquisition Made Practical](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Acquisition-Made-Practical-Learners/dp/0916636003) (LAMP) system for learning language encourages learners to develop phrases and try them in a variety of social situations with native speakers. By being willing to make mistakes, LAMP learners receive useful feedback from native speakers in real-world social situations. Error framing has shown to be useful in learning complex tasks such as programming. In one study, Steele-Johnson showed that error framing showed [positive effects on metacognition and self-efficacy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617273).

How can we incorporate error framing into our lessons? We need to reduce the negative emotions associated with errors, instead casting errors as a "[natural part of learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292881989_Enhancing_firm_performance_and_innovativeness_through_error_management_culture)". Sharing experiences of learning from errors can encourage students to adopt a growth-mindset. Associating improvement-based praise with errors can also encourage positive emotions associated with making errors in learning. Finally, the use of [live coding]({{ page.root }}/15-live/) as the focus for teaching allows for teachers to model how errors can be positively framed and the process for overcoming them.

### Grit/Perseverance  

Angela Duckworth, a Psychology professor from University of Pennsylvania suggests that grit is an essential trait in learning. Grit can be defined as [perseverance and passion in the face of difficulty towards a defined long term goal](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cvg1mbz0xrfx25l/DuckworthGross2014.pdf). Students with grit are willing to fail in their pursuit if they feel that it gets them closer to their goal. Often, learning and recovering from failure is an essential skill in many fields. Additionally, students with grit have shown to have a higher degree of success later on in life. However, grit is not an innate trait; there is much evidence that suggests that grit is a trait that can be learned and instilled in students.

How can we instill and foster grit in adult students? There are many ways we can help our students attain grit.

- *Modeling resilience by sharing experiences of struggle*. Sharing your own experiences of having difficulty learning certain computing concepts may help students understand that the process of learning can be difficult. Sharing failures that were learning experiences may aid in modeling resilience.
- *Promoting Perseverance*. Part of grit is being able to push through even when the going is difficult. Improvement-based praise is an important motivating tool to promote perseverance.
- *Sharing Passion*. Talking about why you persist in working in your field despite the difficulties and challenges is another way to instill grit.
- *Emphasizing Long-Term Goals*. Showing the effects of learning the concepts in terms of student's individual long-term goals can instill passion and drive for learning despite the difficulties of the topic.

### Becoming a lifelong learner  

Surviving the job market nowadays requires the ability to be a lifelong learner, in order to learn and adapt to new skills that may be required by employers. Lifelong learners are capable of what Cal Newport calls "[deep work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)": defined as the "ability to focus intensely on cognitively demanding tasks".

Lifelong learning arises from those who have the growth mindset. Both grit and [curiosity](http://blog.udacity.com/2017/02/grit-yes-curiosity.html) have been identified as [success factors in lifelong learning](http://www.enterrasolutions.com/lifelong-learners-embrace-curiosity-grit/). Often, the process of learning is a difficult journey. By modeling "gritty" behavior and how it has helped us achieve long-term goals, we can foster a "learn-it-all" rather than a "know-it-all" attitude in students.

Emphasizing the role of [help-seeking behavior in the lifelong learning process](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Learning_theories_in_practice/Help-seeking) is important, as it is a critical skill of lifelong learners. Encouraging students to seek help can be difficult when societal norms view seeking help as "stigmatizing, self-threatening behavior". This view of asking help as a stigma can be especially [prevalent in male learners](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15737222). Because of this, we need to reframe help-seeking behavior as a positive behavior to cope with difficulties. Part of this reframing can be modeled by teachers emphasizing that they are also lifelong learners and by admitting the limits of their knowledge. Emphasizing that one's cohort is a powerful source of help is important to establishing a positive learning community.
