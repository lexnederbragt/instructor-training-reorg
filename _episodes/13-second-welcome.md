Yesterday we focused on general aspects of educational psychology and pedagogy. Today we will focus on the specifics of teaching Software and Data Carpentry workshops.
We will look at the lessons that have been written by the Carpentries and discuss how to write new lessons effectively. We will review specific
teaching practices we follow at our workshops and practice using some of them. One of the most important practices is live coding. You rarely
find this approach in a current university setting so we'll spend some time practicing this skill. We will conclude our training with a discussion 
about workshop logistics that will help you plan your first workshop.
