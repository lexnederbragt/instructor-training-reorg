In our final topic in educational psychology, we'll be learning more about human memory:
specifically how to remove unnecessary "load" in order to facilitate learning.

While the graph model of knowledge is inaccurate but useful,
another simple model of knowledge has a sound physical basis.
As a rough approximation, human memory can be divided into two different storage
layers.
The first is called *long-term* or *persistent memory*.
It is where we store things like our password,
our home address,
and what the clown did at our eighth birthday party that scared us so much.
It is essentially unbounded
(barring injury or disease, we will die before it fills up)
but it is slow to access---too slow
to help us handle hungry lions and disgruntled family members.

Evolution has therefore given us a second system called *short-term* or *working memory*.
It is much faster,
but also much smaller:
in 1956,
Miller estimated that the average adult's working memory could hold
[7±2 items][wikipedia-7]
for a few seconds
before things started to drop out.
This is [why phone numbers are typically 7 or 8 digits long](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Bell-Labs-create-phone-numbers-of-7-digits-10-digits):
back when phones had dials instead of keypads,
that was the longest string of numbers most adults could remember accurately
for as long as it took the dial to go around and around.
It's also why sports teams tend to have about half a dozen members,
or be broken down into smaller groups (such as the forwards and backs in rugby).

When we memorize words in a list and are asked to immediately recall
them, the words first presented will have the best chance to be
transferred into long-term memory. On the other hand, the items that
are presented last might still be in short-term memory. These are
referred to as the primacy and recency effects, respectively, and they
together form the
[memory serial position effect][wikipedia-serial-position].

7±2 is probably the most important number in programming.
When someone is trying to write the next line of a program,
or understand what's already there,
she needs to keep a bunch of arbitrary facts straight in her head:
what does this variable represent,
what value does it currently hold,
etc.
If the number of facts grows too large,
her mental model of the program comes crashing down
(something we have all experienced).

7±2 is also the most important number in teaching.
An instructor cannot push information directly into a learner's long-term memory.
Instead,
whatever she presents is first represented in the learner's short-term memory,
and is only transferred to long-term memory after it has been held there and rehearsed.
If we present too much information too quickly,
the new will displace the old before the earlier material has a chance to be consolidated in long-term
memory.

## Strategies For Memory Management

One of our roles as instructors is to make sure that we factor the 
limitations of human memory into our teaching.  Flooding learners with 10, 
20, 30 or more concepts in one hour will simply result in cognitive overload, 
with the result that they may only remember the first and last five minutes 
of the lesson.  

> ## Chunking
>
> Our minds can store larger numbers of facts in short-term memory by creating *chunks*.
> For example, most of us will remember a word we read as a single item, rather
> than as a sequence of letters.
> Similarly, the pattern made by five spots on cards or dice is remembered as a whole
> rather than as five separate pieces of information.
> Chunks allow us to manage larger problems,
> but can also mislead us if we mis-identify something,
> i.e.,

{: .challenge}

Storing words in groups reduces the number of effective
items in your working memory, allowing you to keep 
more information in your head at once. This is one reason
why helping our learners to see the connections among 
the concepts we are teaching is so important.  


## Formative Assessment

The formative assessment and reflective practice described in earlier 
episodes is a key component in helping learners solidify their understanding 
and transfer ideas from short-term memory into long-term memory. It's important
to use formative assessments frequently to help learners transition new concepts
into their long-term memory, before their short-term memory fills up. It can 
be helpful to use pedagogical planning tools to identify the number of concepts 
that are being introduced in a lesson and plan where to include formative 
assessments.

## Concept Maps

One tool that can be used to identify the number of concepts being 
introduced in a lesson is the *concept map*.
A concept map is simply a picture of someone's mental model of a domain:
facts are bubbles,
and connections are labelled arcs.
It is important that they are labelled:
saying "X and Y are related" is only helpful if we explain what the relationship *is*.
And yes,
one person's fact may be another person's connection,
but by *externalizing cognition*
(i.e., making thought processes and mental models visible),
concept maps help spark and focus discussion.

To show what concept maps look like,
consider this simple `for` loop in Python:

~~~
for ch in "abc":
    print(2*ch)
~~~
{: .source}

The three key concepts used in this loop are:

![Key Concepts](../fig/for-loop-concepts.png)

(In this case it's easy to connect the concepts to concrete elements in the program,
but that may not always be the case.)
The key relationships,
which are as important as the concepts themselves,
are:

![Relationships](../fig/for-loop-arcs.png)

A quick count shows that there are actually 6 things here,
not just 3,
so we're already brushing up against the limits of short-term memory.
If we add two more facts to show things that are usually (but not always) true:

![Recommendations](../fig/for-loop-rec.png)

the count rises to 8,
which is a good size for a single teaching episode.
A few other concept maps drawn by previous participants in this training course
are listed below:

* [Array Math](../fig/array-math.png)
* [Conditionals](../fig/conditionals.png)
* [Creating and Destroying Files](../fig/create-destroy.png)
* [Sets and Dictionaries in Python](../fig/dict-set.png)
* [Input and Output](../fig/io.png)
* [Lists and Loops](../fig/lists-loops.png)

Most of these are much larger than our recommended limit,
but that's not necessarily a bad thing:
after drawing a concept map for an entire subject,
a lesson designer can then carve out tightly-connected sub-graphs to make individual episodes.

Concept maps are also a useful way to organize one's thoughts
before putting together a talk or writing a paper.
As with lessons,
they allow us to *externalize cognition*,
i.e.,
to get our thoughts out where we can see them
(and see the contradictions that have happily been swimming around inside our heads
without bumping into each other).

It's very important to use a technique like concept mapping a lesson
before teaching it - an instructor needs to identify just how many pieces of
separate information will need to be "stored" in memory as part of the lesson.

> ## Concept Mapping
>
> Create a hand-drawn concept map for something you would teach in five minutes.
> (Possibly use the same subject about which you created a multiple choice question.)
> Trade with a partner, and critique each other's maps.
> Do they present concepts or surface detail?
> Which of the relationships in your partner's map do you consider concepts and vice versa?
>
> Take 10 minutes to draw the concept maps and share with your neighbor. 
> Write "*done*" in the chat once you have finished.
{: .challenge}

Concept maps can be used in many ways:

1.  To aid solo design of a lesson by helping authors figure out what they're trying to teach.
    Crucially, a concept map separates content from order:
    in our experience,
    people rarely wind up teaching things in the order in which they first drew them.
2.  They aid communication with fellow lesson designers.
    Instructors with very different ideas of what they're trying to teach
    are likely to pull their learners in different directions.
    Drawing and sharing concept maps isn't guaranteed to prevent this,
    but it certainly helps.
3.  Concept maps also aid communication with learners.
    While it's possible to give learners a pre-drawn map at the start of a lesson for them to annotate,
    it's better to draw it piece by piece while teaching
    to reinforce the ties between what's in the map and what the instructor said.
    (We will return to this idea below when discussing Mayer's work on multimedia learning.)
4. Concept maps can be used as a classroom discussion exercise.
	Put learners in small groups (2-4 people each),
	give each group some sticky notes on which a few key concepts are written,
	and have them build a concept map on a whiteboard by placing those sticky notes,
	connecting them with labelled arcs,
	and adding any other concepts they think they need.
4.  Concept maps are also a useful formative assessment technique:
    having learners draw concept maps of what they think they just heard shows the instructor
    what was missed and what was misunderstood.
    Reviewing the learners' concept maps is too time-consuming for use in workshops,
    but very useful in weekly lectures
    *once learners are familiar with the technique*:
    as [Glass observed][amazon-glass],
    any new tool or technique initially slows people down.

## Cognitive Load

In 2006,
Kirschner, Sweller, and Clark published a paper titled
"[Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching][kirschner-paper]".
In the abstract, they say:

> Although unguided or minimally guided instructional approaches
> are very popular and intuitively appealing...these approaches
> ignore both the structures that constitute human cognitive architecture
> and evidence from empirical studies over the past half-century
> that consistently indicate that minimally guided instruction is less effective and less efficient than
> instructional approaches that place a strong emphasis on guidance of the student learning process.
> The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when learners have
> sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide "internal" guidance.
{: .quotation}

The paper set off a minor academic firestorm,
because beneath the jargon the authors were claiming that
[inquiry-based learning][wikipedia-inquiry]---allowing
learners to ask their own questions,
set their own goals,
and find their own path through a subject---doesn't actually work very well.
Kirschner *et al*'s argument was that it requires learners to simultaneously
master a domain's factual content
and its search and problem-solving strategies.
Fostering creativity and independence is intuitively appealing,
but that doesn't mean it works.

One of the paper's authors (Sweller) proposed an alternative
based on the theory of *[cognitive load][wikipedia-cognitive-load]*.
It posits that people have to deal with three things when they're learning:

*   *Intrinsic* load is what they have to keep in mind in order to carry out a learning task.
*   *Germane* load is the (desirable) mental effort required to create linkages between new information and old
    (which is one of the things that distinguishes learning from memorization).
*   *Extraneous* load is everything else that distracts or gets in the way.

Cognitive load theory's proponents claim that eliminating extraneous cognitive load accelerates learning.
Unsurprisingly,
it too has [been criticized][cognitive-load-crit],
most particularly for being unfalsifiable.
Critics of cognitive load theory say that
since there's no way to tell in advance of an experiment whether something is germane or not,
any result can be justified after the fact
by labelling things that hurt performance as "extraneous"
and things that don't as "germane".

However,
some predictions *can* be made.
One example is work by Mayer and colleagues on
the *[split-attention effect][wikipedia-split-attention]*.
Linguistic and visual input are processed by different parts of the human brain,
and linguistic and visual memories are stored separately as well.
This means that correlating different linguistic, auditory, and visual 
streams of information takes cognitive effort:
when someone reads one thing while hearing something else spoken aloud,
their brain can't help but check that it's getting the same information on both channels.
Discrepancies between these channels increase cognitive load and decrease learning.
Learning is therefore more effective when information that is being presented simultaneously
in two different channels is redundant, rather than different. 
For our workshops, this means the instructor should say out loud commands as they type them on the screen
during live coding.

## Faded Examples

According to cognitive load theory,
searching for a solution strategy is an extra burden
on top of applying that strategy.
We can therefore accelerate learning
by giving learners worked examples that show them a problem and a detailed step-by-step solution,
followed by a series of *faded examples*.
The first of these presents a nearly-complete use of the same problem-solving strategy
with a small number of blanks for the learner to fill in.
The next problem is also of the same type,
but has more blanks,
and so on until the learner is asked to solve the entire problem.

Faded examples work because they introduce the problem-solving strategy piece by piece.
At each step,
learners have one new problem to tackle.
This is less intimidating than a blank screen or a blank sheet of paper.
It also encourages learners to think about the similarities and differences between various approaches,
which helps create the linkages in the mental model that instructors want them to form.

For example,
someone teaching Python might start by explaining this:

~~~
# total_length(["red", "green", "blue"]) => 12
def total_length(words):
    total = 0
    for word in words:
        total += len(word)
    return total
~~~
{: .source}

then ask learners to fill in the blanks in:

~~~
# word_lengths(["red", "green", "blue"]) => [3, 5, 4]
def word_lengths(words):
    lengths = ____
    for word in words:
        lengths ____
    return lengths
~~~
{: .source}

The next problem might be:

~~~
# concatenate_all(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "redgreenblue"
def concatenate_all(words):
    result = ____
    for ____ in ____:
        ____
    return result
~~~~
{: .source}

and learners would finally be asked to tackle:

~~~
# acronymize(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "RGB"
def acronymize(words):
    ____
~~~
{: .source}

The key to constructing a good faded example is to think about the problem-solving strategy
or solution pattern that it is meant to teach.
For example,
the series of problems above illustrate the *accumulator pattern*,
in which the results of processing items from a collection
are repeatedly added to a single variable in some way
to create the final result.
